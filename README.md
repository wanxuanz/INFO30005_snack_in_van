## General info
This is project is about creating an vendor app and customer app from scratch. 
* The home page of our website is https://snacks-in-a-van-webg100.herokuapp.com. 
* The customer side application can be accessed by https://snacks-in-a-van-webg100.herokuapp.com/customer.
* The vendor side application can be accessed through https://snacks-in-a-van-webg100.herokuapp.com/vender.

## Detailed info
In detailed info, we will explain the usage of all the links in our server.

Features needs to be delivered in **Deliverable 2 - Mockup App Server** can be found here [App server mockup instruction](#app-server-mockup-instruction). 

_The following inclues other features which are not part of the **Deliverable 2 - Mockup App Server**_

* when you are at page https://snacks-in-a-van-webg100.herokuapp.com/customer/, you will be able to view all the customers' details who are currently stored in our database (the Collection name that the customers details stored is **`customers`**).
