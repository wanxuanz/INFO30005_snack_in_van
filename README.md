# Group Project Repository

Welcome!

We have added to this repository a `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `.gitattributes`.

* **README.md**: is the document you are currently reading. It should be replaced with information about your project, and instructions on how to use your code in someone else's local computer.

* **.gitignore**: lets you filter out files that should not be added to git. For example, Windows 10 and Mac OS create hidden system files (e.g., .DS_Store) that are local to your computer and should not be part of the repository. This files should be filtered by the `.gitignore` file. This initial `.gitignore` has  been created to filter local files when using MacOS and Node. Depending on your project make sure you update the `.gitignore` file.  More information about this can be found in this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore).

* **.gitattributes**: configures the line ending of files, to ensure consistency across development environments. More information can be found in this [link](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes).

Remember that _"this document"_ can use `different formats` to **highlight** important information. This is just an example of different formating tools available for you. For help with the format you can find a guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

- [x] Read the Project handouts carefully
- [x] User Interface (UI)mockup
- [x] App server mockup
- [ ] Front-end + back-end (one feature)
- [ ] Complete system + source code
- [ ] Report on your work(+ test1 feature)


**App server mockup instruction:**
